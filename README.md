In short: all chemical analysis methods are limited by their resolution capability and it is extremely easier to combine multiple chemicals into one mixture, 
than to separate the mixture into individual components. Therefore it is always possible to protect a chemical against chemical analysis structure elucidation by mixing it
with a randomized mixture of other chemicals.
